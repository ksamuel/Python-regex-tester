Python regex tester for Python 2.7+
===================================

This is a full featured web based Python_ regexp tester wih:

- all main `re` methods: `re.search`, `re.match`, `re.findall`, `re.sub`, `re.subn`
- all main regex flags (`re.U`, `re.I`, `re.X`, etc)
- ajax powered live matching as you type the pattern
- match coloration

Try the demo_.

Setup
======

- git clone git://github.com/ksamuel/Python-regex-tester.git regex_tester
- cd regex_tester; python regexp_tester.py

Voil√†. This should open a browser with the regex tester web page.


Dependancies
===================================

None

It uses:

- the Bottle_ Python micro framework
- the `Blueprint CSS`_ framework
- the jQuery_ javascript framework

But all of them are already provided, the whole thing being less than 500 ko.

Since the project was initially only for us to use, it's taking advantages of a few advanced CSS selectors and some HTML 5 goodies. Make sure you have an up to date browser.

What it lacks
=============

- some love: design is not the strong point of the product. And a spiner for ajax requests would help.
- some configuration options: it dont haz it
- some use: I have no time to find bugs or write tests, so please use and report. I only use it in Firefox and Chrome on Ubuntu 11.10 when programming.
- some protection: you can make it crash if you enter huge chunks of text or a pattern with agressive lookaheads

I do accept pull requests :-)

My only plans for the future are, maybe, to create a one-file version of this tool with JS, CSS and HTML embded in the Python source code.

If it ever prove stable and usefull, I may package it. But the program is so easy to start that it may be overkill.

Licence
===========

GPL2.

Honestly, only because that's the first FOSS licence I could find a text copy of when googling.
