Python regex tester for Python 2.7+
===================================

This is a full featured web based Python_ regexp tester wih:

- all main `re` methods: `re.search`, `re.match`, `re.findall`, `re.sub`, `re.subn`
- all main regex flags (`re.U`, `re.I`, `re.X`, etc)
- ajax powered live matching as you type the pattern
- match coloration

Try the demo_.

Setup
======

- git clone this repo
- run regexp_tester.py

Voil√†. This should open a browser with regex tester web page.


Dependancies
===================================

None

It uses:

- the Bottle_ Python micro framework
- the `Blueprint CSS`_ framework
- the jQuery_ javascript framework

All of them are already provided, the whole things is less than 500 ko.


What it lacks
=============

- some love: design is not the strong point of the product
- some configuration options: it dont haz it
- some use: I have no time to find bugs or write tests, so please use and report. I only use it in Firefox and Chrome on Ubuntu 11.10 when programming.
- some protection: you can make it crash if you enter huge chunks of text or a pattern with agressive lookaheads

I do accept pull requests :-)

My only plans for the future are, maybe, to create a one-file version of this tool with JS, CSS and HTML embded in the Python source code.

If it ever prove stable and usefull, I may package it. But the program is so easy to start that it may be overkill.

Licence
===========

GPL2.

Honestly, only because that's the first FOSS licence I could find a text copy of when googling.
